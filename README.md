<p align="left">Hello there,

I'm Vasco, a Lisbon-based frontend developer with a strong foundation in customer care services and a passion for web development. My academic journey includes courses from The Odin Project, Curso em VÃ­deo, OneBitCode, VueMastery, and Code with Guillaume. These experiences have expanded my horizons and fueled my transition into web development.

My career has seen me thrive in customer care roles, honing my communication and teamwork skills. Additionally, I've ventured into web development as a frontend developer, specializing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've showcased my technical abilities through independent projects and challenges from Frontend Mentor. My GitHub portfolio reflects my dedication to the field.

Looking ahead, my focus remains on frontend development. I aspire to contribute to innovative web solutions and user-friendly interfaces. Simultaneously, I'm excited to leverage my extensive customer care background to enhance user experiences. Notably, I've also led MMORPG groups, fostering collaboration between French and English speakers.

I'm eager to connect with professionals who share my passion for development and user-centric design. Whether it's discussing potential collaborations, sharing insights, or simply networking, I encourage you to reach out to me at marques_vasco@yahoo.es. Let's engage in meaningful conversations and explore opportunities for impactful projects together. Feel free to connect anytime!</p>
